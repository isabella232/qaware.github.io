Although the setup is already documented within this SonarSource Community post, this post highlights pitfalls and enables you to adapt any Maven module structure such that it correctly measures and imports code coverage into your SonarQube analysis. This post focuses on using the official documentation from JaCoCo and Sonar.</description></item><item><title>MaLTeSQuE / SANER 2018</title><link>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2018-05-09-maltesque-saner/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2018 15:06:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2018-05-09-maltesque-saner/</guid><description>The 25th conference on Software Analysis, Evaluation and Reengineering (SANER) and its co-located workshops took place in the Italian city of Campobasso on March 20-23, 2018. Due to its remoteness, and train and flight delays, it wasn’t easy to reach, but the hospitability and the amazing food made well up for that.
Day 0 (workshop day) The first day after the long journey started with different workshops. I participated in the workshop on machine learning techniques for software quality evaluation (MaLTeSQuE), presenting an industrial evaluation of machine learning (ML) approaches for run-time anomaly detection.</description></item><item><title>"I know it when I see it": Perceptions of Code Quality (Part 2)</title><link>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2017-12-20-i-know-it-when-i-see-it-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2017 15:06:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2017-12-20-i-know-it-when-i-see-it-2/</guid><description>Background In Part 1 of this article, I have described the motivation and scope of a research project into the perceptions of code quality by different stakeholders. The project has been conducted by a consortium which two scientists from Sweden and I led. The first set of results from that project has been accepted for publication in the ITiCSE’17 proceedings recently1, and that is what I report on in this article.</description></item></channel></rss>
