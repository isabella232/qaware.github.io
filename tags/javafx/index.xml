In this series of blogs we are looking at the current figures of the COVID-19 pandemic with Software-ECG. It is a free time series analysis tool originally developed for time series analysis for system analysis of computer problems in distributed systems. With its COVID-19 edition, QAware has adapted the tool so that the current data from the data hub of the University of Oxford (Our World in Data - OWID) are automatically loaded and immediately available for analysis.</description></item><item><title>Where Is The Second Wave In Russia And China?</title><link>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2020-12-03-software-ecg-second-wave-in-asia/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2020 13:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2020-12-03-software-ecg-second-wave-in-asia/</guid><description>CW 49: Analyzing COVID-19 data with Software-ECG COVID-19 Edition

I had the following requirements for a JavaFX test framework:
Free (as in beer) Software with a permissive license Lean, pure Java framework Integration with JUnit Later on, the requirement to do headless tests was added. I will cover headless tests in a follow-up post.
A quick search reveals three contenders:</description></item></channel></rss>
