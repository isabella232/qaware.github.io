Apart from showing off our toys at our booth and chatting with the nice people at the conference, Leander Reimer presented a hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s guide to cloud native API gateways and we visited the conference talks. In this article we share our key learnings and takeaways with you. Slides or videos are provided where available.

The author encountered this problem while developing a larger reactive application, where a strict separation of different domains of the application is key to maintain a clean architecture.
Reactor is a library for developing reactive applications and its reference guide is a good read to understand the basic principles of reactive programming.</description></item></channel></rss>
