In this project there are various different teams that use different programming languages and the expertise of different team members varies. We developed the backend that other developers, testers etc. use to call skills.

It was a very cool location midst containers (the real ones), cranes and big freight ships. There were three stages, the coolest stage was definitely in the belly of an old ship. I‘ll write about the talks I visited and give a short summary. You find a list of all talks here: https://containerdays.io/program/conference-day-2.html. Videos are coming soon – I’ll edit this post when they are available.</description></item></channel></rss>
