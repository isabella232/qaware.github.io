Apart from showing off our toys at our booth and chatting with the nice people at the conference, Leander Reimer presented a hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s guide to cloud native API gateways and we visited the conference talks. In this article we share our key learnings and takeaways with you. Slides or videos are provided where available.

Virtual Kubelet is an open source Kubernetes Kubelet implementation that allows you to run Kubernetes pods without having to manage nodes with enough capacity to run the pods.
In classical Kubernetes setups, the Kubelet is an agent running on each node of the Kubernetes cluster. The Kubelet provides an API that allows to manage the pod lifecycle.</description></item><item><title>ContainerDays 2018: Top talks on day 2</title><link>https://qaware.github.io/posts/2018-07-11-container-days-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2018 15:06:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qaware.github.io/posts/2018-07-11-container-days-2/</guid><description>I attended the ContainerDays 2018 in the Hamburg Hafenmuseum. It was a very cool location midst containers (the real ones), cranes and big freight ships. There were three stages, the coolest stage was definitely in the belly of an old ship. I‘ll write about the talks I visited and give a short summary. You find a list of all talks here: https://containerdays.io/program/conference-day-2.html. Videos are coming soon – I’ll edit this post when they are available.</description></item><item><title>Impressions from SEACON 2018 - Part 2</title><link>https://qaware.github.io/posts/2018-06-14-seacon-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jun 2018 15:06:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qaware.github.io/posts/2018-06-14-seacon-2/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Domain Driven Design&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Taylorism&amp;rdquo; Henning Schwentner (wps solutions GmbH) presented the concepts behind Domain Driven Design (DDD, see sources123 for general references, and the slides of the talk4). The general idea behind DDD is to structure applications vertically rather than horizontally into domains: Design small, self-contained portions of an application domain rather than attempt to get (only?) the big picture. It doesn’t stop there, though: The domain-structure ought to be established, says Schwentner, not just in the design (aka.</description></item><item><title>Impressions from SEACON 2018 - Part 1</title><link>https://qaware.github.io/posts/2018-06-12-seacon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2018 15:06:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qaware.github.io/posts/2018-06-12-seacon/</guid><description>An extraordinary keynote The first day’s keynote “Umgang mit Komplexität lernen” (learn how to deal with complexity) was held by two 13-year old pupils of the Evangelische Schule Berlin and has been a very interesting start for a Software Engineering &amp;amp; Architecture Conference. Romy Randel and Rosalie Hermann presented in a very professional way the everyday life at their school, in which each student can decide on their own at what pace they want to learn and work on projects.</description></item><item><title>Building IoT 2018 - shaping the Internet of Things</title><link>https://qaware.github.io/posts/2018-06-08-building-iot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:06:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qaware.github.io/posts/2018-06-08-building-iot/</guid><description>I visited the building IoT at Cologne, Germany in June 2018.

We were one of the exhibitors and presented our portable cloud showcase which lets you control OpenShift using a DJ pad. Besides, we held the talks A Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Cloud Native Java EE and Docker und Kubernetes Patterns &amp;amp; Anti-Patterns and visited some others.</description></item><item><title>Software Circus</title><link>https://qaware.github.io/posts/2017-09-18-software-circus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2017 15:06:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qaware.github.io/posts/2017-09-18-software-circus/</guid><description>Intro We just came home from two days of talks, workshops and lots of fun during this year&amp;rsquo;s Software Circus. &amp;ldquo;Cloudbusting&amp;rdquo; was the theme this year and it took place in the lovely city of Amsterdam. The organization team did a great job finding a unique venue: A festival location including a Big Top circus tent, a rusty hangar and a large outdoor area is not quite the setting you expect from a software conference!</description></item></channel></rss>
