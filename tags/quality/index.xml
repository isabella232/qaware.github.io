Due to its remoteness, and train and flight delays, it wasn’t easy to reach, but the hospitability and the amazing food made well up for that.
Day 0 (workshop day) The first day after the long journey started with different workshops. I participated in the workshop on machine learning techniques for software quality evaluation (MaLTeSQuE), presenting an industrial evaluation of machine learning (ML) approaches for run-time anomaly detection.</description></item></channel></rss>
