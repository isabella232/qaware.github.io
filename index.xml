Especially on high load, an efficient JDBC connection pool is important to avoid locked threads, delayed request processing or partial service interruptions.
Payara, closely related to the GlassFish reference implementation of Jakarta EE, comes with its own implementation of a JDBC connection pool. Under high load our application experienced locking deficiencies when it comes to high load.</description></item><item><title>Presenting Software EKG - COVID-19 Edition</title><link>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2020-11-11-software-ekg-covid-19-edition/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2020-11-11-software-ekg-covid-19-edition/</guid><description>Our latest tool to analyze global COVID-19 data.</description></item><item><title>OOP 2020</title><link>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2020-02-28-oop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 10:39:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2020-02-28-oop/</guid><description>A field report from the 2020 OOP conference in Munich.</description></item><item><title>Breaking your build on SonarQube quality gate failure</title><link>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2020-02-17-sonar-qube-build-breaker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2020 10:39:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2020-02-17-sonar-qube-build-breaker/</guid><description>We use SonarQube to do a static analysis of our code for code smells, security bugs and more. SonarQube had a great feature in earlier versions: breaking the build if the quality gate of your project is red. A quality gate defines the metrics you want your code to have, for example: no detected bugs, code coverage 80% or more, no TODO comments. SonarQube quality gates help us to follow the rule &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t live with broken windows&amp;rdquo;1 in our daily work.</description></item><item><title>A Field Report From the O’Reilly Software Architecture in Berlin</title><link>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2019-11-15-oreilly-field-report/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2019 19:15:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2019-11-15-oreilly-field-report/</guid><description>Last week, we were at the O’Reilly Software Architecture in Berlin.

The author encountered this problem while developing a larger reactive application, where a strict separation of different domains of the application is key to maintain a clean architecture.
Reactor is a library for developing reactive applications and its reference guide is a good read to understand the basic principles of reactive programming.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Kubelet - Run pods without nodes</title><link>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2018-07-12-virtual-kubelet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2018 15:06:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2018-07-12-virtual-kubelet/</guid><description>During my recent visit of the ContainerDays 2018 in Hamburg (19.-20.06.2018) I attended an interesting talk held by Ria Bhatia from Microsoft about Virtual Kubelet.
Virtual Kubelet is an open source Kubernetes Kubelet implementation that allows you to run Kubernetes pods without having to manage nodes with enough capacity to run the pods.
In classical Kubernetes setups, the Kubelet is an agent running on each node of the Kubernetes cluster. The Kubelet provides an API that allows to manage the pod lifecycle.</description></item><item><title>ContainerDays 2018: Top talks on day 2</title><link>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2018-07-11-container-days-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2018 15:06:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2018-07-11-container-days-2/</guid><description>I attended the ContainerDays 2018 in the Hamburg Hafenmuseum.

The general idea behind DDD is to structure applications vertically rather than horizontally into domains: Design small, self-contained portions of an application domain rather than attempt to get (only?) the big picture. It doesn’t stop there, though: The domain-structure ought to be established, says Schwentner, not just in the design (aka.</description></item><item><title>Impressions from SEACON 2018 - Part 1</title><link>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2018-06-12-seacon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2018 15:06:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2018-06-12-seacon/</guid><description>An extraordinary keynote The first day’s keynote “Umgang mit Komplexität lernen” (learn how to deal with complexity) was held by two 13-year old pupils of the Evangelische Schule Berlin and has been a very interesting start for a Software Engineering &amp;amp; Architecture Conference.

Due to its remoteness, and train and flight delays, it wasn’t easy to reach, but the hospitability and the amazing food made well up for that.
Day 0 (workshop day) The first day after the long journey started with different workshops. I participated in the workshop on machine learning techniques for software quality evaluation (MaLTeSQuE), presenting an industrial evaluation of machine learning (ML) approaches for run-time anomaly detection.</description></item><item><title>JavaLand 2018</title><link>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2018-04-27-javaland/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Apr 2018 15:06:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2018-04-27-javaland/</guid><description>JavaLand is a Java-focused conference which takes place in the theme park Phantasialand close to Cologne.

One can develop the ESH bindings with IntelliJ, however a crucial question remains open: how to test the developed bindings without having the Eclipse tools at hand? Using IntelliJ to develop the ESH bindings is different to using Eclipse for two main reasons:</description></item><item><title>Software Circus</title><link>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2017-09-18-software-circus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2017 15:06:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2017-09-18-software-circus/</guid><description>Intro We just came home from two days of talks, workshops and lots of fun during this year&amp;rsquo;s Software Circus. &amp;ldquo;Cloudbusting&amp;rdquo; was the theme this year and it took place in the lovely city of Amsterdam.

I show code snippets and compare the performance impact on a real world application.
The Use Case Consider the following use case: A data cache that holds key-value pairs and needs to be accessed by several threads concurrently.
One option is to use a synchronized container like ConcurrentHashMap or Collections.</description></item><item><title>How to use Docker within IntelliJ</title><link>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2016-04-23-docker-intellij/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2016 10:39:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.qaware.de/posts/2016-04-23-docker-intellij/</guid><description>A short tutorial on how to use Docker within intelliJ and with a little help from Gradle.

It&amp;rsquo;s about test driving your application without a predetermined course of action. Although this seems like random free style testing, in the hands of an experienced developer this proves to be a powerful technique to find bugs and undesired behaviour.
